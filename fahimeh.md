my feature:

I'm going to create a form that allows the users add their own news articles. This feature related to the news section which I created before.
I would add a botton => Add your news <= under the news section. 
when user click on it,a new blanck will open.
There is a form on it.
 This form asks about
 -tittle
 -a valid link for the source of the news
 -description 
 -and they can choose a topic for their news.
I need a database to store and manipulate the data. 
The in the database will contain news articles components.
id increment ==> PK
